# Interactive Country Data Visualization

## Current State Analysis

This MVP provides an interactive scatter plot visualization of country data including GDP per capita, population, economic freedom index, and political systems. While functional, there are several areas that need significant improvement.

## Identified Issues & Areas for Improvement

### 🔴 Critical Data Quality Issues

1. **Inaccurate Population Data**: Many countries have severely inflated population figures
   - Luxembourg: 37.9M (actual: ~640K)
   - Singapore: 6M (actual: ~5.9M - this one is close)
   - Germany: 122M (actual: ~83M)
   - Czech Republic: 1.2M (actual: ~10.9M)

2. **Questionable Political System Classifications**:
   - Philippines labeled as "Theocracy" (should be Presidential Republic)
   - Croatia labeled as "Islamic Republic" (should be Parliamentary Republic)
   - Uruguay labeled as "Islamic Republic" (should be Presidential Republic)
   - Chile labeled as "Constitutional Monarchy" (should be Presidential Republic)
   - Iceland labeled as "Islamic Republic" (should be Parliamentary Republic)

3. **Inconsistent Economic Freedom Scores**: Some values appear to be scaled differently

### 🟡 UI/UX Issues

1. **Poor Mobile Responsiveness**: Fixed width/height doesn't adapt well to mobile screens
2. **Cluttered Interface**: Too many controls cramped in small space
3. **Legends Overlap**: Population and political system legends overlap on smaller screens
4. **Poor Color Accessibility**: Default D3 color scheme may not be colorblind-friendly
5. **Information Overload**: Too much data displayed at once without progressive disclosure

### 🟡 Code Quality Issues

1. **Monolithic Component**: 330-line component doing too much
2. **No Error Handling**: No fallbacks for missing data or API failures
3. **Performance Issues**: Recreates entire visualization on every filter change
4. **No TypeScript**: Lack of type safety
5. **Hard-coded Values**: Magic numbers and fixed dimensions throughout

### 🟡 Missing Features

1. **Data Export**: No way to export filtered data or visualizations
2. **Comparison Tools**: No side-by-side country comparison
3. **Time Series**: No historical data or trends
4. **Alternative Visualizations**: Only scatter plot available
5. **Accessibility**: No keyboard navigation or screen reader support
