# TODO: Fix Meeting-Agent and Dictator Deployment Issues

## Current Status: MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - ASSET PATHS ARE NOW CORRECT!

**LATEST BUILD LOG ANALYSIS (Critical Discovery):**
The build verification log shows that the CLI `--base` parameter fix **WORKED**:

```
OSEE (working): src="/public/osee/assets/index-DeRwc5L1.js"
MEETING-AGENT (broken): src="/public/meeting-agent/assets/index-DhmU9UMW.js"  CORRECT PATH!
DICTATOR (broken): src="/public/dictator/assets/index-DVHSzUaM.css"  CORRECT PATH!
```

**CONCLUSION**: The asset paths are now correct for all projects. The issue is NOT with asset path generation anymore.

## Problem Summary

**Working Apps**: osee, deeptube, country-data  
**Broken Apps**: meeting-agent, dictator

**Site Structure**: https://happydreammmer.github.io/public/[app-name]/

## Root Cause Analysis

Since asset paths are now correct (`/public/[app-name]/assets/`), the problem must be:

1. **Code-level issues**: JavaScript errors preventing app initialization
2. **Missing dependencies**: Runtime dependencies not loading
3. **API/Service issues**: App-specific functionality failing
4. **Content Security Policy**: External resources being blocked
5. **Module resolution**: ES modules not loading correctly

## All Attempted Fixes (Chronological)

###  SUCCESSFUL FIXES:
1. **Asset Path Generation**: Added `--base=/public/[app-name]/` to build scripts
2. **Build Cache Clearing**: Added comprehensive cache clearing in GitHub Actions
3. **Deployment Structure**: Fixed GitHub Actions deployment to correct `/public/` structure
4. **Build Verification**: Added post-build verification showing asset paths are correct

### L FAILED ATTEMPTS:
1. Manual copying of build assets to root directories
2. Modifying vite.config.ts base paths multiple times
3. Changing GitHub Actions deployment structure
4. Clearing various cache directories
5. Modifying HTML files directly

## Current State Analysis

**What's Working:**
- All projects build successfully
- Asset paths are correctly generated as `/public/[app-name]/assets/`
- Static HTML pages work perfectly
- osee, deeptube, country-data load correctly

**What's Broken:**
- meeting-agent and dictator don't load/function properly
- No console errors reported for asset loading
- Apps likely have runtime JavaScript issues

## Next Steps for Resolution

### 1. **JavaScript Runtime Analysis**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors on broken pages
- Verify all ES modules are loading correctly
- Check for API call failures or network issues

### 2. **Code-Level Debugging**
- Compare working vs broken app source code
- Check for missing error handling
- Verify all imports/dependencies are correct

### 3. **Browser Network Tab Analysis**
- Check if all assets are loading (200 status)
- Verify no CORS issues
- Check for failed API calls

### 4. **Specific App Issues**
- **meeting-agent**: Check React app initialization
- **dictator**: Check vanilla JS app initialization and importmap resolution

## Key Insights

1. **Asset path issue is SOLVED** - the CLI `--base` parameter worked
2. **The problem is now runtime/code-level**, not build/deployment
3. **Need to focus on JavaScript execution and app initialization**
4. **Working apps (osee, deeptube, country-data) can serve as reference**

## Recommended Next Action

**Stop build/deployment fixes** and focus on:
1. Browser console debugging of broken apps
2. Code comparison between working and broken apps
3. Runtime error analysis and JavaScript initialization debugging

The deployment and build process is now working correctly. The issue has shifted from infrastructure to application-level problems.
